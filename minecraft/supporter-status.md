# Supporter
![supporter_frog.png](/supporter_frog.png)
The `supporter` rank is a temporary / reoccuring rank you get for voting on VelvetMC!

## Activating
The main way to activate your supporter status is by using `/vote` or visiting our [PlanetMinecraft](https://velvet.moe/vote) to vote for our network. This will give you `24 hours` of supporter, and you will need to vote again once it expires.

Alternatively, you can **boost** our Discord server through your linked account to obtain supporter for the duration of your boost, and or upgrade to Donator (cosmetic features + infinte supporter benefits)!

We also might give out a variable amount of supporter credit (extension of your supporter status) for downtime, issues with activation, and special events. 

## Benefits
- [VeinMiner](/minecraft/veinminer)
- ChestSort
- No RTP cooldown
- HeadDB access
- Jukebox
- Chat-color and formatting
- Other cool [commands](/home)!

## Supporter Status
Supporter Status (displayed on the <kbd>TAB</kbd> menu) shows the amount of time remaining until you lose supporter, and will have to activate again to keep the benefits.

If you do not currently have an active supporter rank it will display `Expired!`

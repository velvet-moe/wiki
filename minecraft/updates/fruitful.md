# Fruitful!
![fruitful.png](/assets/fruitful.png)

Hey everyone! We hope you had an amazing Spooktober, and welcome to the start of November!
We were planning on doing something spooky during October, but we got too bottled down working on bug fixes and so many features for this update!

For more information about the big changes, check out their dedicated wiki page by clicking on the name.

With that out of the way, let's get into it!

## [Claims](/minecraft/claims)!
The claims' system has been entirely overhauled (and your claims have been transferred), now giving you a beautiful GUI (accessible with `/lands`) and so many more options for you to manage your claims, settlements, and NATIONS!

Below is a small excerpt of the many features this brings to the table!

## [Seasons](/minecraft/seasons)!
You heard that correctly, we have added full-fledged seasons to VelvetMC!

## [Shop](/minecraft/shop)
A shop has finally been added, along with an entire economy and stock market accessible with `/shop`

## [Villagers](/minecraft/villagers)
Some villager behavior has been overhauled to increase QOL!

- Villagers now spawn with a random name both visible above their head and in the GUI.
- Villagers will now follow you if you are holding an `emerald_block`. (like cows following wheat)
- Villagers now have a global death message when they die.
- Raids now have a wave display when starting a new one. (ex, Wave 1/x)

### Bad Omen
> This feature is expermiental and might be removed in the future
{.is-warning}

Killing a banner pillager no longer gives you Bad Omen, you must light them on fire to start a raid.

This was done due to people accidentally setting off raids as a measure to prevent that.

## Notable mentions
- An auction house was added for items which aren't sold on the shop! `/ah`
- ... (find more from changelog, pls)
- Bug fixes and performance enhancements.

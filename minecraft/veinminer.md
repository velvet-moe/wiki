## What is VeinMiner
VeinMiner (or you might know it as [Ore Excavation](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ore-excavation)) is our server-side implementation of the mod, allowing you to mine multiple ores and other resources at once (given the valid tool).

## Commands
-- `/vm toggle` - Allows you to toggle it on and off
-- `/vm mode` - Allows you to set the mode for activating veinminer, avaiable modes are `sneak`, `stand`, `always` and `client`.

## Usage
By default, you can veinmine ores and other materials using <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> (or your designated sneak key)
If `/vm mode` is set to `client`, it will use the custom keybind you set in the client-side [VeinMiner Companion](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/veinminer-companion) mod.
